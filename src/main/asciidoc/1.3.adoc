== jQAssistant Java 8 Plugin Version 1.3

- Fix for bug https://github.com/buschmais/jqa-java8-plugin/issues/1[Concept `java8:FunctionalInterface` is not complete^].
  Now the Java 8 plugin labels all Java interfaces with `FunctionalInterface`
  if it has exact on abstract method. Prior to that fix only Interfaces with the
  annotation `@java.lang.FunctionalInterface` where recognized as functional interface.
